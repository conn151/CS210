1) I feel like the feedback of the user is just as important as getting my own take on a program. I feel the use of the user story gives the project developers an organized way read over suggestions or experiences, and develope upon those ideas. User stories help keep all the information organized and easily understandable.

2) I approach it one step at a time. I know if I decide to develop, I take things in slowly, and learn as I go. If I put too much on my plate, I will surely fail due to stress and being overworked. Using agile's size of the groups, I would incorporate that to ensure nobody has a huge amount on their plate, and an efficient amount of work can be done.

3) The team is as weak as its weakest player, is something I like to say a lot. Being apart of a team means putting in your time and effort into a project. Slacking off or not putting in any effort will only hurt the process of the team, and will lead to failure. To being a good team member means to put in the time and the effort, and accepting mistakes, and learning from them.
